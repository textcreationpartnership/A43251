#The most true and wonderfull narration of two women bewitched in Yorkshire who coming to the assizes at York to give in evidence against the witch, after a most horrible noise, to the terror and amazement of all the beholders, did vomit forth before the judges, pins, wool and hafts of knives, &c., all which was done (to make the wonder more wonderfull) without the least drop of bloud or moisture from their mouths : also a most true relation of a young maid not far from Luyck who being bewitched in the same manner did (most incredibly) vomit forth wadds of straw, with pins a crosse in them, iron nails, needles, points, and whatsoever she had seen in the basket of the witch that did bewitch her / as it is attested under the hand of that most famous phisitian Doctor Henry Heers ; together, how it pleased God that he was afterwards recovered by the art of physick, and the names of the ingredients and the manner how to make that rare receipt that cured her.#
